# Waiting_list

> This repository contains a python project in object-oriented programming

You can generate a wainting list for hospital or other things:

### Subject

Through this activity, I will implement a Queue type data structure, then Priority Queue, with the aim of creating a display screen in an emergency waiting room at the hospital. The next patient treated as well as the next 9 are displayed on the screen.
A small interface allows the nurse who greets patients to enter their names and the priority of the emergency.
The File and Priority File structures are implemented firstly by dynamic arrays (Python list) then by linked lists.
The comparison of their time efficiency is carried out

### Knowledge required

* Python language basics
* Complexity of an algorithm
* Concepts of object-oriented programming
* Linear structures such as Lists, Queue and Stack

### Skills mobilized

* Distinguish interface and implementation.
* Write multiple implementations of the same data structure.
* Specify a data structure by its interface.
* Distinguish structures through the use of methods that characterize them.
* Choose a data structure adapted to the situation to be modeled
